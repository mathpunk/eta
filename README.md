Extract, Transform, And...

## About

Fairly recently I learned the acronym ETL for Extract, Transform, Load. From context I've gathered, that's when you recognize that the problem of getting your data ready for analysis and use is enough of a problem that you should consider it separately. "Most of our work," say the data scientists I've talked to, "is data janitorial work."

I have a couple-three large collections of text that I've created or squirreled away for several years. Every so often I try and create a project to analyze and remix this text, but now I recognize my ETL was complected with the specifics of the analysis or remixing I had in mind. For this project, I will concentrate on extracting the data to host it myself. I just learned about Clojure seesaw, which wraps Java Swing for vastly increased usability; I will consider doing some very basic visualization as well.

## Usage

Dunno yet.
